This examples folder contains six executables:

1. random_cube_{cpu/gpu}

2. random_cube_large_{cpu/gpu}

3. test_C_wrapper{_cpu/gpu}


The random cube examples demonstrate the treecode's performance
using uniformly distributed cubes of random particles, load balanced
with Zoltan's recursive coordinate bisection.

The argument given to the executable is a parameter file that
specifies the run. An example is given here as example.in. For
example, one would run:

    random_cube_cpu example.in

to run the random_cube_cpu example with the parameters specified in
the file example.in.

The parameters in the infile are as follows:



1. The random_cube_{cpu/gpu} examples are designed for reproducibility
of results--given a total number of particles across all ranks, the
actual random particles will be the same no matter how many ranks
are used.

2. The random_cube_large_{cpu/gpu} examples are designed to test the
problem size limits of the treecode by overcoming limits in Zoltan's
maximum array sizes. Unlike random_cube_{cpu/gpu}, which first 
generates all random particles and then uses Zoltan to load balance them,
these examples generate a small number of particles, load balances
them, determines the resulting bounding boxes, and then generates the
specified number of random particles in those bounding boxes. The results
produced in terms of performanc and accuracy should be very similar to
the random_cube_{cpu/gpu} examples.

3. The test_C_wrapper_{cpu/gpu} example demonstrates how to use the C
wrapper for the treecode.
