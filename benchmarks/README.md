Benchmarks
----------

Run the benchmarks by providing the full path to the desired compiled version (`run_readin_rism_cpu`, `run_readin_rism_gpu` or `run_readin_rism_gpu_cuda`) present in the build directory and the desired input file: `test_coulomb.in`, `test_dcf.in` or `test_tcf.in`. Make sure to be in the same folder as the input file.
